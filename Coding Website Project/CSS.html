        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written 
        in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, 
        including layout, colors, and fonts.
        This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control 
        in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting 
        by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition 
        in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed 
        between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

    <br>
    <br>
    <p1 class="para1">
        In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
    </p1>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Elements</li>
        <li>Id</li>
        <li>Class</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="h1">Elements</h1>
    <p2 class="para2">
        The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
    </p2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="h2">Id</h2>
    <p3 class="para3">
        The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
        The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element !
        To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
    </p3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="h3">Class</h3>
    <p4 class="para4">
        The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
        To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.
