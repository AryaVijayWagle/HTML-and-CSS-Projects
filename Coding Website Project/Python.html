            Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
            Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
            Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. 
            It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), 
            object-oriented and functional programming. 
            It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
            Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language 
            and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.
            Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, 
            was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. 
            Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.
            Python onsistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.
