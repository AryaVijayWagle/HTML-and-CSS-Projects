    <p class="para">
        C is a general-purpose computer programming language. 
        It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. 
        By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. 
        It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly for application software. 
        C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers 
        and embedded systems.

    <h1 class="h1">Integers</h1>
    <p1 class="para1">
        In C programming language, integer data is represented by its own datatype known as int.
        Range of unsigned int is 0 to 2^32-1.
        Range of signed int is -2^31 to 2^31-1.

    <h2 class="h2">Float</h2>
    <p2 class="para2">
        Float is a data type that enables the user to declare variables and assign floating point values to the variable.

    <h3 class="h3">Character</h3>
    <p3 class="para3">
        In the C programming language, the character set refers to a set of all the valid characters 
        that we can use in the source program for forming words, expressions, and numbers.
        The source character set contains all the characters that we want to use for the source program text. 
        On the other hand, the execution character set consists of the set of those characters that we might use 
        during the execution of any program. 
        Thus, it is not a prerequisite that the execution character set and the source character set will be the same, 
        or they will match altogether.

    <h4 class="h4">Double</h4>
    <p4 class="para4">
        Double is also a datatype which is used to represent the floating point numbers. 
        It is a 64-bit IEEE 754 double precision floating point number for the value. It has 15 decimal digits of precision.

    <h5 class="h5">Long</h5>
    <p5 class="para5">
        Range of long is -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.
