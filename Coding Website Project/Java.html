        <p class="para">
            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language 
            that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
            It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, 
            run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. 
            Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) 
            regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
            The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, 
            but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
            The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) 
            that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. 
            As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, 
            particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

        <h class="h">Object Oriented Programming Language</h>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p1 class="para1">
            Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", 
            which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), 
            and the code is in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

        <h1 class="h1">Commands used in Java</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Public, private and protected</li>
            <li>class</li>
            <li>static</li>
            <li>String</li>
            <li>System.out.print</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="h2">Public, private and protected :-</h2>
        <p2 class="para2">
            The access specifiers are used to define the access restriction on the class and members of a class.
            <ul>
                <li>The private access modifier is the most restrictive access level. 
                    Class and interfaces cannot be private. 
                    Members that are declared private can be accessed outside the class.</li>
                <li>The public access modifier can be associated with class, method, constructor, interface, etc. 
                    Public can be accessed from any other class. 
                    Therefore, fields, methods, blocks declared inside a public class can be accessed from any class.</li>
                <li>The protected access modifier can be associated with variables, methods, and constructors, 
                    which are declared protected in a superclass can be accessed only by the subclasses in other package or any class 
                    within the package of the protected members' class.</li>
            </ul>
        </p2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3 class="h3">Class</h3>
        <p3 class="para3">
            A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
        </p3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4 class="h4">Static</h4>
        <p4 class="para4">
            The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. 
            We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. 
            The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.
        </p4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5 class="h5">String</h5>
        <p5 class="para5">
            In Java, string is basically an object that represents sequence of char values. 
            An array of characters works same as Java string.
        </p5>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h6 class="h6">System.out.print</h6>
        <p6 class="para6">
            To print a text in the console window, we use the pre-programmed method System.out.print.
        </p6>
        <h7 class="h7">Basic code in Java</h7>
        <p7 class="para7">
            <pre>
                public class Main 
                {
                    public static void main(String[]args)
                    {
                        System.out.print("Hello");
                    }
                }
            </pre>
        </p7>
        <p8 class="para8">
            The program should be stored in a file bearing the name as that of the class i.e. Main.java
