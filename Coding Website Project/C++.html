    <p class="para">
        C++ is a high-level general-purpose programming language created by 
        Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". 
        The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features 
        in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. 
        It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, 
        including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM, 
        so it is available on many platforms.

    <h1 class="h1">Integers</h1>
    <p1 class="para1">
        A basic integer type is specified using some legal sequence of keywords drawn from the set 
        {char, short, int, long, signed, unsigned}.
        Syntax for declaring variable a : int a;
    </p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="h2">Float</h2>
    <p2 class="para2">
        Float is a type of datatype that can store Floating-point values. A float datatype acquires 4 bytes in memory.
        Syntax for declaring variable a : float a;
    </p2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 class="h3">Double</h3>
    <p3 class="para3">
        This data type is widely used by programmers and is used to store floating-point numbers. 
        All real numbers are floating-point values. 
        A variable can be declared as double by adding the double keyword as a prefix to it. 
        You majorly used this data type where the decimal digits are 14 or 15 digits.
        Syntax for declaring variable a : double a;
    </p3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4 class="h4">String</h4>
    <p4 class="para4">
        The string type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). 
        This is not a built-in type, but it behaves like one in its most basic usage. 
        String values must be surrounded by double quotes.
        Syntax for declaring a string : string a="Hi";

                This is what a using declaration looks like. 
                A using declaration brings every declaration with a given name to a scope.

            <td>public, protected and private</td>
            <td>
                The keywords public, protected, and private are used as access specifiers in a class.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>enum</td>
            <td>
                An enumeration is a user defined type. We declare enumeration using the enum keyword.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>new</td>
            <td>
                The new keyword (also a operator) is used to create objects in free store (also referred to as heap).

        Hint : For displaying the size of the object, sizeof operator is used.
        For example, sizeof(a) displays the size of object a.
