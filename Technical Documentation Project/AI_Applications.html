		With new generative AI capabilities in Search, we are now taking more of the work out of searching, so you will be able to 
		understand a topic faster, uncover new viewpoints and insights, and get things done more easily. Lets take a question like 
		“what's better for a family with kids under 3 and a dog, bryce canyon or arches.” 
		Normally, you might break this one question down into smaller ones, sort through the vast information available, and start 
		to piece things together yourself. With generative AI, Search can do some of that heavy lifting for you.
		You will see an AI-powered snapshot of key information to consider, with links to dig deeper.

		Like in so many industries, the use of data and AI is transforming advertising at a rapid pace. Consumers are seeing these 
		changes in the personalized ads on their web browsers, the chatbots that help them make buying decisions. But what exactly 
		is AI-powered advertising?
		AI in advertising refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and 
		mimic their actions based on the information that is fed to them. They use historical data to learn from past experiences 
		and use it to make smarter decisions in the future. Advertisers can use AI to create more personalized experiences, target 
		the right audience, and make decisions faster.

	   <pre class="pre3">
		Recommender systems provide personalized service support to users by learning their previous behaviors and predicting their 
		current preferences for particular products. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly computational intelligence and 
		machine learning methods and algorithms, has been naturally applied in the development of recommender systems to improve 
		prediction accuracy and solve data sparsity and cold start problems.

	   <pre class="pre4">
		A recommender system, or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing 'system' with a synonym such as platform or engine), 
		is a subclass of information filtering system that provide suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user. 
		Typically, the suggestions refer to various decision-making processes, such as what product to purchase, what music to listen to, 
		or what online news to read. Recommender systems are particularly useful when an individual needs to choose an item from a 
		potentially overwhelming number of items that a service may offer.

		The AI has to interact with multitude of sensors and has to use data in real time. Many AI algorithms are computationally 
		intensive and are therefore hard to use with CPUs that have memory and speed restrictions. Modern vehicles are an example 
		of real time systems that have to produce deterministic results in the time domain. This is related to achieving safety 
		while driving the vehicle. Complicated distributed systems like these require a lot of internal communications that are 
		prone to latency which can disturb the decision making of the AI algorithms. In addition there is the issue of power 
		consumption of the software running in the car. The more intensive AI algorithms consume more power, which is an issue, 
		especially for electric vehicles that depend only on the charge of the battery (Carmody, Thomas, 2019).
		AI is used for several important tasks in a self driving automobile. One of the main tasks is path planning.   
		That is the navigation system of the vehicle (Sagar and Nanjundeswaraswamy, 2019). Another big task for  AI is the 
		interaction with the sensory system and the interpretation of the data coming out of sensors.
